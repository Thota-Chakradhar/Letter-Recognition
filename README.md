# Letter-Recognition-through-Ensemble-Classification
<br> > Exploratory data analysis is done on the data to do the Data Preprocessing if needed.
<br> > Classes/Labels distribution in the data is visualized by using PCA.
<br> > Hyper parameter Tuning is done on various Classification algorithms (Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, Linear and Non-Linear SVM).
<br> > Error Plots and Heat maps are generated to validate the performances of Classifiers with various parameter values to determine the          optimal parameter configuration.
<br> > Homogeneous(Dependent, Independent), Heterogeneous Ensemble methods are applied to the Classifiers with optimal parameter                  configuration.
<br> > Error Plots are visulaized to validate the performance of Ensemble Classifiers to find the optimal no.of estimators.
<br> > Two tail Pair T-test is conducted to find the statistical difference between the Classifier Performances/Accuracies. 
<br> > Time Plots are generated to find the quick learner which is efficient in every manner and can have the best performance among all          classifiers.
<br> > Specificity and Sensitivity of the classifier is also validated along with Time complexity and overall Accuracies to determine the          best Hypothesis.
