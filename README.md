# Letter-Recognition-through-Ensemble-Classification
<UL>
<li> Exploratory data analysis is done on the data to do the Data Preprocessing if needed.</li>
<li> Classes/Labels distribution in the data is visualized by using PCA.</li>
<li> Hyper parameter Tuning is done on various Classification algorithms (Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, Linear and Non-Linear SVM).</li>
<li> Error Plots and Heat maps are generated by using Matplotlib and Seaborn packages respectively to validate the performances of Classifiers with various parameter values to determine the optimal parameter configuration.</li>
<li> Homogeneous(Dependent, Independent), Heterogeneous Ensemble methods are applied to the Classifiers with optimal parameter                  configuration.</li>
<li> Error Plots are visulaized to validate the performance of Ensemble Classifiers to find the optimal no.of estimators.</li>
<li> Two tail Pair T-test is conducted to find the statistical difference between the Classifier Performances/Accuracies. </li>
<li> Time Plots are generated to find the quick learner which is efficient in every manner and can have the best performance among all          classifiers.</li>
<li> Specificity and Sensitivity of the classifier is also validated along with Time complexity to determine the best Hypothesis. </li>
