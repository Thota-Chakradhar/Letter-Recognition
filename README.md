# Letter-Recognition-through-Ensemble-Classification
1) Exploratory data analysis is done on the data to do the Data Preprocessing if needed.
> Classes/Labels distribution in the data is visualized by using PCA.
> Hyper parameter Tuning is done on various Classification algorithms (Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, Linear and Non-Linear SVM).
> Error Plots and Heat maps are generated to validate the performances of Classifiers with various parameter values to determine the optimal parameter configuration.
> Homogeneous(Dependent, Independent), Heterogeneous Ensemble methods are applied to the Classifiers with optimal parameter configuration.
> Error Plots are visulaized to validate the performance of Ensemble Classifiers to find the optimal no.of estimators.
> Two tail Pair T-test is conducted to find the statistical difference between the Classifier Performances/Accuracies. 
> Time Plots are generated to find the quick learner which is efficient in every manner and can have the best performance among all classifiers.
> Specificity and Sensitivity of the classifier is also validated along with Time complexity and overall Accuracies to determine the best Hypothesis.
